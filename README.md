# Branching

- git merge
- git rebase


## git merge

when we merge â›œ  two branches, the new commit is created for that merge.


> **git merge feat**

```
              merge comming
                      |
                      V
main   -  -  -  -  -  =  -
            \        /
feat         -  -  -

```


## git rebase

when we rebase our branche, no new commit is created.
It updats the code till the latest commint. just like shifting the parent commit of children.

- use this command to see commit graph

      git log --graph --oneline --all
